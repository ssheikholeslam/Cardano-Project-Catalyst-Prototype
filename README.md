# Cardano Project Catalyst

<h3 align="center">Community Managed Proposal System - Proposal Statement</h3>
&emsp; The Fund9 - Community Managed Proposal System (Idea #23519) aimed at remediating the Project Catalyst developer community’s need for streamlined developmental access to IdeaScale’s Project Catalyst code base. Our proposal team focused on reverse engineering IdeaScale’s web application with open-source resources (i.e. ASP.NET web framework, Visual C#, and MongoDB) under the hood. 

&emsp; While aiming to maintain the Catalyst community’s familiarity with IdeaScale’s UI/UX, our team strived to integrate novel functionalities gauged to ease some of the contemporary struggles faced by users (e.g. proposal reviewal, data retrieval latency, obfuscated source code). Amongst recreating IdeaScale’s UI (see Figure 1 below), our team also integrated MongoDB’s NoSQL, document-based data architecture at the front of the web application’s back end. This structure hoped to ease PA and vPA reviewals by providing an easily exportable and formattable JSON schema (see Figure 2.1 - 2.2 below).

&emsp; For auditability purposes, all developmental assets and other supply chain resources were kept open source. The code base is currently hosted in a public GitHub repository (https://github.com/ssheikholeslam/Cardano-Project-Catalyst-Prototype). The application’s open-source nature hoped to provide Catalyst developers with the liberty to develop and advance the proposal system in ways that better suit the community.

&emsp; Development of the web application is planned to continue with several items on the proposal teams docket. A few of the top items include continuing to reverse engineer the current IdeaScale application, easing idea proposal process for participating Catalyst members, designating a portal for PA and vPAs to conduct proposal review, and embedding a rules engine to prevent botted proposal votes/reviews.
